Promises: future value/error

    Think of it as guarantee that something will happen in the future



async Task 1: Add the item to the cart on amazon
    Go to amazon
    Select item
    Add the item to the cart (return Promises<Item>)


async Task 2: Check out the item
    Go to amazon
    Go to the cart (item.resolve || item.reject)
    Check out the item




1. async keyword has to be used to to achieve asynchronous functions ===> functions that return promises instead of value

2. if the async function is calling any function that returns a promise, then you must give the await keyword
